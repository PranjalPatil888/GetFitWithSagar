JMX - is designed for exposing Java Virtual Machine (JVM) metrics.
Blackbox - is designed for exposing metrics based on probes such as HTTP, TCP, ICMP, etc. These probes do not provide detailed metrics about the underlying service or system.
Node exporter - is ideal for detailed monitoring of Linux servers, including metrics such as CPU and disk utilization
SNMP - is designed for exposing network devices metrics via the Simple Network Management Protocol.
